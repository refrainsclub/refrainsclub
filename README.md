# James Blair

I'm currently a high school student in New Zealand, looking for work experience.

I enjoy web development, network and system administration and Linux.

Otherwise I spend my time watching nerdy videos, playing Farm Merge Valley or sleeping.

I'm taking Computer Science papers at the University of Waikato while still in high school.

*Currently open for commision. Feel free to flick me an email at [james@blair.nz](mailto:james@blair.nz)*
